# Hybrid Automated Planning Module (HAPM)
Welcome to the Hybrid Automated PLanning Module repository! In it you will find the code used for my master's thesis (An Adaptive and Gamified Educational Experience using Chatbots) experiments.

In here you will find both test case codes: Project Management (PM) and Study Exam (SE). You will find the domains and the different proposed problems.

Additionally, you will find the chatbot prototype that implements the HAPM.
